[![Scrape](https://github.com/pkd2512/codeschool-webscraper/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=webpage-scraper)](https://github.com/pkd2512/codeschool-webscraper/actions/workflows/main.yml)
### Getting started with scraping data from the web using NodeJS

Having ready-to-use data is cool, but what about data that is not readily downloadable from the internet? What if manual download is a hassle when there are lots of information and sources involved?

What to expect?
- Getting and storing data as JSON or CSV
- Collecting information from webpages
- Automating scraping with GitHub actions

Download or clone the repository from GitHub to see the demo scraper in action. This branch specifically demonstrates a webpage scraper in action to get data from a HTML table.
